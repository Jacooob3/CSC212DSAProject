B-Tree

This project is a simple implementation of a B-Tree data structure in C++. The B-Tree is used to store and search student data, which is read from a csv file. The implementation allows users to perform searches for specific student data using the B-Tree's binary search algorithm.



B-Tree Implementation

A B-Tree is a self-balancing search tree that can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data. In this project, we have implemented a B-Tree that stores student records, which consist of a student's ID, name, classes. 

The B-Tree implementation in this project supports the following operations:

* Insertion of new student records
* Deletion of existing student records
* Insertion or deletion of existing student classes
* Searching for student records by student ID
* All students data could be printing out



Planning

Before implementing B-Tree, we discussed the basic requirements of the project. We decided to use a B-Tree data structure to store and search student records because it is an efficient way to perform binary searches on large numbers of records.

We also discuss how B-trees work in this project, including the specific requirements for the student records that will be stored. We decided to include Student ID, Last Name, First Name, Class 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the record because these are common attributes used to identify and differentiate students.

Additionally, we determined the format and content of the CSV data file used to populate the B-tree with student records.



In Conclusion

Overall, this project provides a simple implementation of a B-Tree data structure written in C++ that can be used to store and search student records. B-Tree implementations are based on well-known algorithms and techniques designed to handle large datasets efficiently and scalable.
